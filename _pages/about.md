My name is Shinwoo Kim, and I am a student at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://pitt.edu)'s [School of Computing and Information](https://sci.pitt.edu) & [David C. Frederick Honors College](https://www.frederickhonors.pitt.edu/) where I study Computer Science and Mathematics. My current interests are in the field of **Computer Systems, Operating Systems, and Computer Architecture**, although there are very few things in computer science that I'm _not_ interested in. Currently, I work as a [teaching assistant]({{ '/teaching/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for Pitt's Computer Science Department where I love trying new techniques to help students students learn in my courses. Additionally, I am also the Lead Software Developer for the [_TouchTheInvisible_](https://touchtheinvisible.com) project at the University of Pittsburgh.

Previously, I worked at the University of Pittsburghâ€™s [Hill District Community Engagement Center](https://cec.pitt.edu/hilldistrict/) as the STEAM ambassador[^sponser] where I taught students in underprivileged areas about computer science and information technology.[^cec-work] I have also served on the advisory board as a founding member for the [Spreading Neurodiversity Acceptance Project](https://snapfse.com/), a Pittsburgh organization which promotes the awareness of neurodiverse communities.<span class="endmark"></span>
