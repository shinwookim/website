PantherBudget is a very simple budget application for a single user. The application supports storing:
- several budget categories with a set monthly limit for each category (e.g., \\$825 for rent, \\$400 for groceries, \\$130 for gas, etc.)
- purchases with associated date and price (with purchases that are over the budget for the month highlighted in red)

The backend is implemented in Python Flask with SQLite as the underlying database. This backend can be accessed via a RESTful API using the standard HTTP methods.

The frontend is implemented in REACT and uses AJAX to interact with the Flask backend.<span class="endmark"></span>
