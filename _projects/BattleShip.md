Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. The game dates back to World War I and was traditionally played as a *pencil-and-paper game*. In the 1960s, American board game manufacturer, Milton Bradley, released a plastic version to wide success.[^1] 

This app is a recreation of that classic board game with rules identical to the original (ten-by-ten grids with 3 types of game pieces). The game supports full [*hotseat multiplayer mode*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotseat_(multiplayer_mode)) with each player passing the computer back-and-forth.

The entire game logic is written in vanilla JavaScript using only traditional DOM manipulation. As such, there are no dependencies or reliance on outside libraries. Similarly, the entire styling is done using manually written HTML and CSS.<span class="endmark"></span>
