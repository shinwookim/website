## Hyperparameter Optimization 
This area is directed towards the automated selection and tuning of hyperparameters in an effort to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of intrusion detection systems based on machine-learning methods.

## Explainable Artificial Intelligence - XAI 
This subject deals with the development of machine-learning models that are not just effective, but are also transparent and interpretable. The goal is to create IDSs that users can not only trust but also understand.
