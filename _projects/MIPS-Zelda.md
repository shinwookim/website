This is a 2D adventure game made in the style of the old *Legend of Zelda* games. The game was written entirely in [MIPS assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) from scratch and is designed to be run on the [MARS assembler](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/). The game implements everything from a variety of weapons choices, functioning enemy AI, and a score system.<span class="endmark"></span>
