This page will provide information regarding the things I go over in recitation. Please check back for updates regularly, especially if you miss a recitation.

## Course Description
A *Computer System* is comprised of both hardware and software working in concert to accomplish useful work. In this course, we will explore the issues of programming a real computer system by examining the abstractions, interfaces, and design decisions that influence the way that software runs. In addition, we will look at the role of the operating system in managing system resources and providing abstractions.{% marginfigure 'mf-mem' 'https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pointers.png' 'Pointers, [XKCD 138](https://xkcd.com/138/)' %}
