This page will provide information regarding the things I go over in recitation. Please check back for updates regularly, especially if you miss a recitation. For other course materials including lecture slides and lab/project handouts, please see the [**course website**](https://cs0449.gitlab.io/sp2023/).

## Course Description
A *computer system* is comprised of both hardware and software working in concert to accomplish useful work. In this course, we will explore the issues of programming a real computer system by examining the abstractions, interfaces, and design decisions that influence the way that software runs. In addition, we will look at the role of the operating system in managing system resources and providing abstractions.{% marginfigure 'mf-mem' 'https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pointers.png' 'Pointers, [XKCD 138](https://xkcd.com/138/)' %}

## Recitation
My recitation sections accompany professor **Luis Oliveira**'s lecture **section 1090** which meets Tuesdays and Thursdays 2:30–3:45pm in the 405 Information Science Building. We will meet **every Friday at 12:00 PM in [5502 Information Science Building](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1315#!m/386791)** unless announced otherwise. 

You may attend **only** the recitation section you are signed up for unless you have received permission from the course instructor. 

## Classroom Technologies
Throughout the semester, we will be using the following resources and technologies in this course.  

### Discord
[Discord](https://discord.com/) is an instant-messaging platform similar to Skype, Microsoft Teams, and Slack. The course instructor has created a Discord server dedicated to this class which you should be able to join using the invite link on [Canvas](canvas.pitt.edu){%sidenote "discord-expires" "The invite link will expire after fourteen days. If you get a message "*Link has expired*", please contact your course instructor for a new invite"%}. We will use Discord to send announcements and extra materials; and you can use Discord to communicate and collaborate with your fellow classmates. If you ask a question on Discord, you may well get a response from one of your classmates faster than you would get a response if you were to email the teaching team. Note that there are some guidelines about asking for help through Discord — Please review the academic integrity section on the syllabus carefully.

### Poll Everywhere
[Poll Everywhere](https://pollev.com/home) is a platform that I will be using for for administering in-class practice questions. You may create an account if you wish, but this is not required. During recitation, you can log in on a computer, on your phone. PEV questions are not counted for a grade, meaning you can answer them freely without worrying about getting the question wrong.

### Gradescope
[GradeScope](https://www.gradescope.com/) is a tool designed to streamline and standardize assignment grading. You should create an account and link it to your Canvas classroom (Click 'GradeScope' in Canvas' sidebar). On GradeScope is where you will submit all the work (electronically) for this course; you will find deadlines for assignments and grade on there as well.
