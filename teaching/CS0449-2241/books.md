The official text for this course is Bryant & Oâ€™Hallaron's [*Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (3rd Edition)*](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/home.html).{% marginfigure "CSAPP Cover" "http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/images/csapp3e-cover.jpg" "[**Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective**](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/home.html)<br>*Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron*"%} The book, written by the [people across fifth avenue](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), provides great explanations and various practice problems on the topics we cover in this course; the chapter on dynamic memory management is particularly well-written. Students enrolled in CS 449 should have access to this book as part of [RedShelf's](https://www.redshelf.com/) inclusive access which can be accessed via [Canvas](canvas.pitt.edu).{%sidenote "opt-out" "Although CS:APP will be our 'official textbook', we will not be using it much (other than as additional reference).
